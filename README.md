# SQL-PY
My task were the following: 
- Create two tables, one to store the users and one for the todos
- Add a column to the todo table
- Insert data into the tables
- Query all tasks that are done
- Update John's tasks and mark them as done
- Delete tasks from the todo table that are done already
- Drop the tables

But if I drop the table how should I prove I done my task? Lets make a python program what is show step by step the tasks.
